Friday Favorites! What's your favorite Disney World or Disneyland snack?

As the holidays approach, we're all going to have plenty of opportunity to eat. But before you get too full of turkey and stuffing, we want to think about the snacks we enjoy when visiting Disney World or Disneyland and ask which is your favorite? Do you keep it cool with a Dole Whip or Lefou's Brew? Is your trip not complete unless you've had a churro or two? Maybe you enjoy a bucket of popcorn while watching the parades and fireworks. Would you prefer a turkey leg? Or maybe a Mickey-shaped ice cream bar? 

We're getting hungry just thinking about the snacks you can enjoy in Disney World and Disneyland. Let us know which is your favorite Disney snack. And be sure to share! Invite your friends, family, neighbors, dental hygienist, newspaper delivery person, and the next person you receive an email from to come join the conversation!
